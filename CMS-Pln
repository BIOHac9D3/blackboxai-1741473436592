Store Front Template Development Plan
This plan outlines the development of a store front template using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, along with a Python backend for the administrative CMS dashboard. The goal is to create a performance-optimized, secure, and maintainable e-commerce platform with a focus on minimizing static image usage through special character support.

1. Project Overview
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (with libraries like FontAwesome for icons, Bootstrap for responsive design, and jQuery for DOM manipulation).
Backend: Python (Flask/Django), SQLAlchemy for database management, and Stripe for payments.
Database: PostgreSQL or MySQL for structured data storage.
Security: Implement measures against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and account botting.
CMS: Admin dashboard for managing products, categories, users, and orders.
2. Development Phases
The project will be divided into phases to ensure redundancy-proof development.

Phase 1: Frontend Development
Header

Create a responsive header with:
Retailer logo (static image).
Store name (text).
Social media icons (using FontAwesome or similar libraries).
Search bar.
Use CSS3 for styling and animations.
Navigation Bar

Build a dynamic navigation bar with:
Dropdown menus for categories, subcategories, and product groups.
Links for "Locations & Contacts," "Partner Sub-Menu," "Cart," "Register," and "Login/Logout."
Use JavaScript for dropdown functionality and Bootstrap for responsiveness.
Content Display Area

Design a flexible content area to display:
Categories, products, user profiles, and partner portal features.
Use CSS Grid or Flexbox for layout management.
Footer

Include standard footer content:
Links to "About Us," "Privacy Policy," "Terms of Service," etc.
Contact information and social media links.
Use HTML5 semantic tags for better SEO.
Special Character Support

Replace static icons with Unicode characters or icon libraries (e.g., FontAwesome) wherever possible.
Phase 2: Backend Development
Database Design

Create tables for:
Users, products, categories, orders, and partners.
Use SQLAlchemy for ORM.
Admin Dashboard

Develop a secure CMS dashboard for:
Managing products, categories, and user accounts.
Viewing and processing orders.
Use Flask/Django for backend logic.
Authentication and Authorization

Implement secure login/logout functionality.
Use Flask-Login or Django’s built-in authentication system.
Add role-based access control (e.g., admin, partner, user).
Payment Integration

Integrate Stripe for secure payment processing.
Handle payment success/failure callbacks.
Security Measures

Implement:
CSRF protection.
Input validation and sanitization.
Rate limiting to prevent account botting.
Phase 3: Integration and Testing
Frontend-Backend Integration

Connect the frontend to the backend using RESTful APIs or Django templates.
Ensure seamless data flow for product listings, user profiles, and cart functionality.
Testing

Perform unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT).
Use tools like pytest for backend testing and Selenium for frontend testing.
Performance Optimization

Optimize database queries.
Use caching (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data.
Minify CSS and JavaScript files.
Phase 4: Deployment and Maintenance
Deployment

Deploy the application using a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean).
Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
Monitoring and Maintenance

Use monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, New Relic) to track errors and performance.
Regularly update dependencies and security patches.
